     Revolution &nbsp; of &nbsp; Grocery &nbsp; Shop
  </div> 
  <div class="material">
    The grocery business is changing and it’s changing fast. You can call it a revolution, 
    another victim in the retail apocalypse, the latest sector to be disrupted by tech or
     yet another industry being “killed” by millennials. One thing is for certain: a grocery
      revolution began in earnest in 2017, and it’s far from over. An industry that was the stable,
       boring bedrock of the consumer market for decades came under pressure from all directions
        this past year. The moats which had protected this reliable business were drained by new
         technologies, growing consumer revolt from our current unsustainable food system,
          and a looming logistics revolution on the horizon.

Food had always been local, and this new system changed that. It centralized vendor 
purchasing and in the process eliminated a lot of the transparency. Food is a basic 
human need. It is virtually recession proof, with thin margins offset by scale.
 Consumers are loyal to their brands, and relatively consistent in their buying 
 habits. Much (but not enough) of the food we eat is perishable and requires 
 semi-regular restocking trips. It makes for a dull, but steady business, with 
 a few large multinationals controlling most of the market.

There was a revolution in the grocery business in 2017, and it’s far from over. 
The industry will further resemble a dumbbell, with the lowest cost, most 
convenient providers on one end, and the most talented curators of products
 and experiences on the other and not much left in the middle. Remember A&P? 
 They filed for Chapter 11 in 2015. Just as the rise of the grocers made the
  current food system possible at the turn of the 20th century, all these
   influences in the beginning of the 21st century are going to create a new
    food system. There will be more of what worked, enabled by technology to
     increase scale, efficiency, and logistics, as well as an opportunity for
      something new, healthier, and more sustainable. The outcome will be 
      determined by those companies responsive enough to listen and adjust to 
      the changing tastes and demands of consumers.
